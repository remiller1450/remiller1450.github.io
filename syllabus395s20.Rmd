## Course Description:

Students will work in small teams on an applied data science project completing the full spectrum of the data science process including developing the problem statement, collecting and processing data, identifying and employing mathematical and/or statistical methods to extract information from the data, implementing the quantitative methods in an appropriate programming environment, and generating conclusions supported by data

## Text:

There are no required textbooks for this course, but the following resources are recommended (and freely available):

- Learning how to program in R: [The introductory labs on this page](https://remiller1450.github.io/sta230f19.html), beginning with "Intro to R"
- Learning how to use SQL, Python, and R: [DataCamp online learning modules](https://remiller1450.github.io/sta230f19.html)
- Statistical learning and modeling: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) and its higher level companion [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf)

## Course Aims:

The overarching goal of this course is to prepare students to navigate an applied data science project by working on a team to answer questions posed by an external client.  This involves developing "soft" skills, such as understanding and communicating client needs, translating those needs into actionable items, and making easily understand recommendations; as well as "hard" skills, such as learning and implementing the techniques needed to solve these problems.

## Learning Objectives:

The specific learning goals for this goal include:

- Develop skills in organizing, cleaning, and wrangling data
- Develop or expand coding proficiency
- Learn and apply new methods of modeling or visualization as needed to address specific project questions
- Communicate methods and results to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Evaluate the decisions being made in other data science projects by providing constructive feedback
- Develop project management skills, practicing how to work with others who may disagree in pursuit of a common goal
- Develop an ability to build relationships with a project client

## Software:

Coding proficiency is expected in this course. You may use any language(s) suitable for the needs of your project; however using either `R` or Python is strongly recommended, as these languages are most commonly used by professional data scientists.

## Policies:

**Attendance**

This course is collaborative, making attendance is *critical*.  All absences permitted by the college (athletics, religious observation, etc.) must be communicated as early as possible and will not count against you. All other absences (illness, job interviews, etc.) can negatively impact your grade if they are persistent and excessive. The schedule below summarizes the impact of such absences (college permitted absences do not counts towards this schedule):

- 1-4 absences (communicated) - No impact so long as they are communicated in at least 4 hours  in advance, or are retrospectively accompanied by appropriate documentation (doctor's note, etc.)
- 1-4 absences (not communicated) - Deduction of 0.5% from the final course grade for each non-communicated absence
- 5th absence - Deduction of 5% from the final course grade
- 6th absence -Deduction of 10% from the final course grade
- 7th absence - Final course grade is capped at "C"

**Workload**

This class meets twice a week for 80 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes), it is expected that you devote, on average, approximately 9 hours and 20 minutes of time each week towards the course.

**Academic Honesty**

At Grinnell College you join a conversation among scholars, professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you submit-all these are ways you participate in this conversation.

The College presumes that your work for any course is your own contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to take responsibility for that contribution. That is, you should strive to present ideas and data fairly and accurately, indicate what your own work is, and acknowledge what you have derived from others. This care permits other members of the community to trace the evolution of ideas and check claims for accuracy.

Failure to live up to this expectation constitutes academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is misrepresenting someone else's intellectual effort as your own. Within the context of a course, it also can include misrepresenting your own work as produced for that class when in fact it was produced for some other purpose.  A complete list of dishonest behaviors, as defined by Grinnell College, [can be found here](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#alleged-violation).

**Curricular Practical Training**

F-1 students enrolled in this course must secure [Curricular Practical Training](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/StudentAffairs/OISA/Shared%20Documents/F-1%20Curricular%20Practical%20Training%20for%20Internships.pdf) authorization through the Office of International Student Affairs prior to your off campus engagement.

**Inclusive Classroom**

Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.  Students need to provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources, information [can be found here](http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services).  Students should then speak with me as early as possible in the semester so that we can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course and coordinate your accommodations.

**Religious Holidays**

Grinnell College encourages students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with your instructor in the first three weeks of classes so that you may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance, and the requirements of the course.


## Grading:

**Ongoing items** (55%):

- Three midterm peer evaluation reports (15%)
    - 10% determined by the quality of the reports you produce evaluating the other members of your team
    - 5% determined by the consensus of the other students' peer assessment of you
- Bi-weekly progress briefings (15%)
    - 10% determined by the quality of your delivered progress reports
    - 5% determined by the ability of your group to meet its short-term goals from the prior briefing
- Advisor assessments (15%)
    - 10% determined by the documentation of your feedback to the groups delivering progress briefings
    - 5% determined by the quality of written take-over memo and presentation to occur mid-semester
- Personal growth (10%)
    - 5% participation
    - 5% skill acquisition and growth throughout the semester (communication, computing, analytic thinking, organization, etc.)

**Final Products** (45%):
