## Course Information:

**Instructor**:

- Ryan Miller, Noyce 2217, millerry\@grinnell.edu

**Class Meetings**: 

- Noyce 2401, T/Th 1:00-2:20PM

**Office Hours**

- Noyce 2217, M 2:30-3:30PM, T 2:30-3:30PM, Th 3:30-4:30PM, or by appointment

## Course Description:

Students will work in small teams on an applied data science project completing the full spectrum of the data science process including developing the problem statement, collecting and processing data, identifying and employing mathematical and/or statistical methods to extract information from the data, implementing the quantitative methods in an appropriate programming environment, and generating conclusions supported by data

## Text:

There are no required textbooks for this course, but the following resources are recommended (and freely available):

- Learning how to program in R: [The labs on the page](https://remiller1450.github.io/sta230f19.html), starting with "Intro to R"
- Learning how to use SQL, Python, and R: [DataCamp online learning modules](https://remiller1450.github.io/sta230f19.html)
- Statistical learning and modeling: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)

## Course Aims:

The overarching goal of this course is to prepare students to navigate an applied data science project by working on a team to answer questions posed by an external client.  This involves developing "soft" skills, such as understanding and communicating client needs, translating those needs into actionable items, and making easily understand recommendations; as well as "hard" skills, such as learning and implementing the techniques needed to solve these problems.

## Learning Objectives:

The specific learning goals for this goal include:

- Develop skills in organizing, cleaning, and wrangling data
- Develop or expand coding proficiency
- Learn and apply new methods of modeling or visualization as needed to address specific project questions
- Communicate methods and results to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Evaluate the decisions being made in other data science projects by providing constructive feedback
- Develop project management skills, practicing how to work with others who may disagree in pursuit of a common goal
- Develop an ability to build relationships with a project client

## Software:

Coding profficiency is expected in this course. You may use any langauge(s) that is suitable for the needs of your project; however using either `R` or Python is strongly recommended, as these are the langauges most commonly used by professional data scientists.

## Policies:

**Attendance**

This course is collaborative, meaning attendence is *critical*  All absences permitted by the college (athletics, religious observation, etc.) must be communicated as early as possible and will not count against you. All other absences (illness, job interviews, etc.) can negatively impact your grade if they become excessive. The schedule shown below summarizes the impact of these absences (college permitted absences do not counts towards this schedule):

- 1-4 absences (communicated) - No impact so long as they are communicated in advance, or are retrospectively accompanied by appropriate documentation (doctor's note, etc.)
- 1-4 absences (not communicated) - Deduction of 0.5% from the final course grade for each absence
- 5th absence - Deduction of 5% from the final course grade
- 6th absence - Additional 5% deduction from the final course grade
- 7th absence - Final course grade is capped at "C"

**Academic Honesty**

At Grinnell College you join a conversation among scholars, professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you submit-all these are ways you participate in this conversation.

The College presumes that your work for any course is your own contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to take responsibility for that contribution. That is, you should strive to present ideas and data fairly and accurately, indicate what is your own work, and acknowledge what you have derived from others. This care permits other members of the community to trace the evolution of ideas and check claims for accuracy.

Failure to live up to this expectation constitutes academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is misrepresenting someone else's intellectual effort as your own. Within the context of a course, it also can include misrepresenting your own work as produced for that class when in fact it was produced for some other purpose.  A complete list of dishonest behaviors, as defined by Grinnell College, [can be found here](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#alleged-violation).

**Inclusive Classroom**

Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.  Students need to provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources, information [can be found here](http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services).  Students should then speak with me as early as possible in the semester so that we can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course and coordinate your accommodations.

**Religious Holidays**

Grinnell College encourages students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with your instructor in the first three weeks of classes so that you may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance, and the requirements of the course.

**Getting Help**

The Math Lab (Mathematics Learning Center - 2012 Noyce Science Center) has tutors in statistics that are available 7 days a week.  See the website for additional information and hours: http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/areas/math-stats/math-lab

## Grading:

**Engagement, Participation, and Labs** - 15\%

Active participation during class is expected. Lectures include numerous disucssion questions, practice problems, and applications. As an instructor, I will keep notes of participation (or lack thereof) during these situations, which will be used to qualitatively assess this portion of your grade.  Class attendance indirectly contributes to this area of your grade - if you aren't in class it is difficult for me to discern your level of engagement with the course materials.  Labs will also contribute to this category.  After each lab you and your group will submit a lab write-up, these write-ups are graded primarily for effort and completion with a lower empthasis on correctness than other course assignments.  

**Homework** - 15\%

Homework will be assigned once per week.  No late homework will be accepted (unless my permission is obtained in advance of the due date), but your lowest two (2) scores will be dropped.  Homework is due at the beginning of class on the specified due date.  Please turn in a paper copy of your assignment, including any printed graphs (if they are asked for).  I encourage you to work with other students or visit the Math Lab for help on homework questions, but you should clearly understand all your answers and your assignment should be entirely in your own words.  If you engage in significant collaboration with classmates or tutors, you must explicitly acknowledge that person(s) on the top of your assignment (again, you are encouraged to collaborate, I want to emphasize that there is no penalty for doing so).

**Exams (3)** - 15\%, 15\%, 20\%

Exams will be closed notes and only basic calculators will be allowed (ie: no cellphone or graphing TI-8X calculators).  You are expected to take the exam on the scheduled date and time, if you have a conflict with an exam date make sure to notify me immediately.  Alternative exam arrangements need to be made at least one week in advance of the time you plan to take the exam; this includes taking the exam in a different location, or times going beyond the given class time.  Alternative arrangements are not guaranteed unless proper notification is given.

**Final Project** - 20\%

There will be an ongoing group project throughout the semester. The project will include a few short progress reports before culminating in a short in-class presentation and a three (3) page written report in the last week of the semester. Details can be found in the [Final Project Assignment Sheet](s209s19\project209.html)
