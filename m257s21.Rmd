You can find course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left. Please note that some material may not be posted until we've reached that point in the course.


### Lecture Slides

Lectures in this class will be relatively short, consisting of roughly 20-30 minutes of presentation at the beggining of each class meeting. They will focus on the fundamental concepts and theory that are necessary precursors to the topics for that day/week.

### In-class Labs

The majority of in-person class time will be devoted to working on hands-on labs. These assignments will focus on connecting the concepts/theory from lectures with practical applications. 

In general, labs are to be completed with a partner, with responses to the embedded questions due on Mondays. You and your partner can expect to receive roughly 45 minutes of class time each day to work through these labs, which should be sufficient to come close to finishing them.  This in-class time investment is very important to succeeding in this course, and you should expect check-ins with the instructor to ensure you're making good progress.

- Week 1 (1/19 and 1/21)
    - [R programming fundamentals](m257s21/Lab1_Intro_R.html)
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Monday 1/25 at 11:59pm
- Week 2 (1/26 and 1/28)
    - [Data Exploration in R](m257s21/Lab2_Graph_Stats.html)
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Monday 2/1 at 11:59pm
- Week 3 (2/2 and 2/4)
    - [Simple linear regression](m257s21/Lab3_Basic_Models.html)
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Monday 2/8 at 11:59pm
- Week 4 (2/9 and 2/11)
    - K-nearest neighbors and model comparisons
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Monday 2/15 at 11:59pm
- Week 5 (2/16 and 2/18)
    - Project #1 meetings and presentations (no lab this week)

### Problem Sets

There will be 4-5 problem sets assigned throughout the semester. These assignments can sometimes be quite lengthy, so if you wait until the last minute to begin them you'll likely not have enough time.

    - Due: Friday Feb 12th at 11:59pm
    - You should submit your responses via Canvas
    - I encourage you to write your solutions in R Markdown (this is not a requirement)
- Problem Set #2

### Projects

- Project #1 (presented in-class on Thursday 2/18)

### Datasets

- [Golden State Warriors](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/GSWarriors.csv)
    - This dataset documents each of the 82 games in the record setting 2015-16 Golden State Warriors season. It was obtained from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
- [Colleges 2019](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019.csv)
    - This dataset contains select variables describing higher education institutions that primarily bachelors degrees. It was obtained from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive government database.  For each institution, it includes enrollment and admissions variables, student demographics, costs and faculty salaries, as well as student outcomes such as median debt upon graduation and median 10-year salary.
- [Iowa City Home Sales](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/IowaCityHomeSales.csv)
    - This dataset contains information on homes sold in Iowa City, IA between 2005 and 2008.  It was scraped from the Johnson County county assessor website, and it contains information such as the home's sale price, assessed value, square footage, and features.  
- [Tips](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Tips.csv) 
    - These data were recorded by a waiter in national chain restaurant located in a suburban shopping mall in the early 1990s. The data document various aspects of each table served by the waiter, including the total bill, tip, size of the party, time of day, day of the week, and whether the party included a smoker.  The data were originally obtained from the textbook: *Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis: With R*
