### Schedule and Syllabus

Welcome to course website for MATH 257 - Data Modeling!  On this page you can find all materials we'll use throughout the semester, starting with the syllabus linked below:

- [Click here](syllabus257s21.html) to view the course syllabus

You can find course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left. Please note that some material may not be posted until we've reached that point in the course.


### Lecture Slides

Lectures in this class will be relatively short, consisting of roughly 20-30 minutes of presentation at the beggining of each class meeting. They will focus on the fundamental concepts and theory that are necessary precursors to the topics for that day/week.

- Week 1 - Introduction (1/19 and 1/21)
    - [What is modeling?](m257s21/intro.pdf)
    - Review of statistical inference
- Week 2 - Data Exploration (1/26 and 1/28)
    - Data exploration
    - Confounding variables
- Week 3 - Basic Models - part 1 (2/2 and 2/4)
    - Simple linear regression
    - K-nearest neighbors
- Week 4 - Basic Models - part 2 (2/9 and 2/11)
    - Evaluating model fit
    - Inference
- Week 5 - Project #1 (2/16 and 2/18)
    - Work time and meetings on Tuesday
    - Presentations on Thursday

### In-class Labs

The majority of in-person class time will be devoted to working on hands-on labs. These assignments will focus on connecting the concepts/theory from lectures with practical applications. 

In general, labs are to be completed with a partner, with responses to the embedded questions due on Mondays. You and your partner can expect to receive roughly 45 minutes of class time each day to work through these labs, which should be sufficient to come close to finishing them.  This in-class time investment is very important to succeeding in this course, and you should expect check-ins with the instructor to ensure you're making good progress.

- Week 1 (1/19 and 1/21)

- Week 2 (1/26 and 1/28)
    - Data Exploration in R
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Monday 2/1 at 11:59pm
- Week 3 (2/2 and 2/4)
    - Simple linear regression and K-nearest neighbors
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Friday 2/8 at 11:59pm
- Week 4 (2/9 and 2/11)
    - Model evaluations and insights
    - Submit your answers via Canvas by Friday 2/12 at 11:59pm
- Week 5 (2/16 and 2/18)
    - Project #1 meetings and presentations (no lab this week)
    
### Recommended Readings

The readings listed below are *recommended* prior to attending class. It has been my observation that students who diligently complete these readings have been the most successful.

- Week 1 (1/19 and 1/21)
    - [R for Data Science - Ch. 4 and 5 (Basic workflow and data transformation)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)
    - [R for Data Science - Ch. 23 (Model basics)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html)
    - [ISLR - Ch 1 (Introduction)](https://statlearning.com/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)
- Week 2 (1/26 and 1/28)
    - [R for Data Science - Ch. 3 (Data visualization)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
    - A Second Course in Statistics - Ch 1.8 and 1.9 (Review of Stat Inference)
- Week 3 (2/2 and 2/4)
    - Coming soon
    
### Problem Sets

There will be five problem sets throughout the semester containing a mixture of conceptual, theoretical, and applied problems.  These assignments are lengthy, so if you wait until the last minute to begin them you'll likely not have enough time.  I suggest beginning each problem set shortly after it is assigned.

- [Problem Set #1](m257s21/HW1.html)
    - Due: Friday Feb 5th at 11:59pm
    - You should submit your responses via Canvas
    - I encourage you to write your solutions in R Markdown (this is not a requirement)
- Problem Set #2

### Announcements and Other Materials 

- Project #1 Guidelines
    - Coming soon
- Project #2 Guidelines

### Datasets

- [Golden State Warriors](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/GSWarriors.csv)
    - This dataset documents each of the 82 games in the record setting 2015-16 Golden State Warriors season. It was obtained from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
- [Colleges 2019](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019.csv)
    - This dataset contains select variables describing higher education institutions that primarily bachelors degrees. It was obtained from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive government database.  For each institution, it includes enrollment and admissions variables, student demographics, costs and faculty salaries, as well as student outcomes such as median debt upon graduation and median 10-year salary.
