## Introduction

1-2 paragraphs that clearly articulate the guiding question motivating your research.

## Background

1-2 paragraphs that address the significance/relevance of your work. This is includes a summary of the research that others have done in this area, as well as a rationale for why people should care about your topic.

## Methods

2-3 paragraphs addressing how you obtained your data, any pre-processing steps you needed to make your data workable, and descriptions of statistical methods you used.  You should not include any results, summaries, or graphs in this section.

## Results

2-3 paragraphs describing your findings plus at least one graphs or table.  The typical results section begins with descriptive results (how many cases, descriptive summaries of your variables, data visualizations, etc.) before proceeding to inferential results (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3.5, fig.align='center'}
## Remember to insert graphics using code blocks
## Be aware of the chunk options "fig.height", "fig.width", and "fig.align"
plot(1:10, rnorm(10), type = "l", main = "Example embedded graph")
```

## Discussion

2-3 paragraphs putting your findings into context and acknowledging limitations of your analyses
