### Policies

**Class Sessions**

The core component of our class meetings will be working through hands-on labs in a paired programming environment.  These pairs will be assigned during the first half of the semester. After the first project, you will have the freedom to choose your partner, or work independently near someone that you can occasionally consult with.  During labs it is essential that you and your partner(s) work together, making certain that each of you understand your work equally well.

Most labs will begin with a brief "preamble" section that we will go through together as class. The purpose of this section is to introduce the topic of the lab and ensure a smooth start to each class meeting.

**Attendance** 

Because this course involves substantial group work absences impact not only yourself, but also your classmates.  That said, I understand that missing class is sometimes necessary.  If you will be absent for any reason I ask to be notified as soon as possible. Showing up late or missing class more than twice without prior notice will negatively impact the participation component of your course grade.

**Late Work**

Assignments are generally due at 11:59pm on their assigned due-date. All assignments will have an automatic 48-hour grace period during which they can still be submitted with a 5% penalty applied.  After 48-hours, P-web assignment windows will close, but late work may still be submitted via email with a 20% penalty, unless solutions have been posted/shared or grades/feedback have been returned.  Special exceptions to these policies must be arranged in advance of an assignment's deadline, or coordinated with Grinnell College academic support.

**Software**

Software is an essential component of data science and will play an important role in this course.  We will primarily use `R`, an open-source statistical software program. You will also be expected to write, document, and submit code used for projects and assignments throughout the semester.

You are welcome to use your own personal laptop, or a Grinnell College laptop, during the course. `R` is freely available and you can download it and it's UI companion, `R Studio`, here (note: `R` must be downloaded and installed before `R Studio`):

1. Download `R` from http://www.r-project.org/
2. Download `R Studio` from http://www.rstudio.com/

You may also work on a classroom computer, all of which will have `R` and `R Studio` pre-installed.

**Academic Honesty**

At Grinnell College you are part of a conversation among scholars, professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you submit-all these are ways you participate in this conversation.

The College presumes that your work for any course is your own contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to take responsibility for that contribution. That is, you should strive to present ideas and data fairly and accurately, indicate what is your own work, and acknowledge what you have derived from others. This care permits other members of the community to trace the evolution of ideas and check claims for accuracy.

Failure to live up to this expectation constitutes academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is misrepresenting someone else's intellectual effort as your own. Within the context of a course, it also can include misrepresenting your own work as produced for that class when in fact it was produced for some other purpose.  A complete list of dishonest behaviors, as defined by Grinnell College, [can be found here](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#alleged-violation).

**Inclusive Classroom**

Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.  To receive accommodations, students must provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources, information [can be found here](http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services).  If you plan on using accommodations in this course, you should speak with me as early as possible in the semester so that we can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course.

**Religious Holidays**

Grinnell College encourages students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with your instructor in the first three weeks of classes so that you may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance, and the requirements of the course.

### Grading

**Engagement and Participation** - 5\%

Participation in a lab-heavy course is absolutely critical. During labs you are expected to help your partner(s) learn the material (which goes beyond simply answering the lab questions), and they are expected to help you.  Everyone will begin the semester with a baseline participation score of 80\%, which will then move up or down depending on my subjective assessment of your behavior during class.  You can very quickly raise this score to 100\% by doing a superb job helping your lab partner(s), and working diligently to understand course material during class.  Alternatively, you can lower this score by skipping class, letting your lab partner(s) do most of the work, using your phone or surfing the web during class, etc.  If you are ever unsure of your participation standing, you can email me and I am happy to provide you an interim assessment.

**Labs** - 20\%

All labs contain embedded questions that you and your lab partner will answer together. Each group member should submit their own copy of the group's answers via P-web prior to the assignment's due-date. Oftentimes multiple labs will be due at the same time, and you are welcome to upload your answers as a single file. Some lab questions will be scored for accuracy with feedback given, while others will be scored for effort/completion.  If it becomes clear that you are your partner are using a "divide and conquer" approach to answering lab questions your score on that assignment will be penalized. Sketch solutions will typically be posted 3-5 days after lab write-ups are due. Any lab that is turned in after sketch solutions are posted will receive no more than 50% credit. 

**Individual Homework** - 20\%

There will be 5-7 individual homework assignments throughout the semester. These assignments are naturally cumulative, and intended to force you to combine concepts and methods from multiple labs. You are welcome to get help from DASIL mentors, or Professor Miller, on these assignments, but your submissions should be your own work, and you should add the name(s) of anyone you received help from as a footnote on the question that they helped you with. Most homework assignments will also include a short reading and a reflection.

**Data Cleaning/Visualization Take-home** - 10\%

This assessment is intended to measure your ability to clean and manipulate complex data to arrive at a specific endpoint (recreating a data visualization). The task should take approximately 4 hours to complete, but will have 48-hours to work on the assessment once it is assigned.

You can find details on the take-home [at this link](s230s23/project1.html)

**Midterm Project** - 20\%

For this project, you will develop an `R Shiny` app that visually explores a data set of your choosing. You may work on this project *individually*, or in a group of *two*. You will deliver a 5-minute in-class presentation demonstrating the capabilities of your app and discussing some of the trends in your data that your app displays. You will be evaluated on both the features of your app and how well you communicate what you see in the data.

You can find details on Midterm #2 [at this link](s230s23/project2.html)

**Final Project** - 25\%

This project is a start-to-finish data science application on a non-trivial data set. The final product is a three-page written report accompanied by R code and documentation. You may work on this project *individually*, or in a *group of two or three*.

### Misc

**Why use R for Data Science?**

If you’ve spent time reading about data science online you’ll undoubtedly have noticed the emphasis placed on the Python programming language. Indeed, research from Cal State University found Python was the most popular data science language in private industry, being mentioned in 42% of data scientist job postings. However, `R`, which was mentioned in 20% of job postings, is not far behind and offers a few advantages when approaching data science from a statistical perspective (hence this course having the STA prefix).  

Both `R` and Python provide plenty of functions for data manipulation. However, because R was created by academic statisticians, it offers very strong data visualization and statistical modeling packages. On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language that excels in production, deployment, and machine learning. Regardless of each language’s strengths and weaknesses, as an introductory course our focus is on the fundamental skills and thought processes used in data science – which is something that can be accomplished regardless of the tools used (which will change over time anyways).

**Getting Help**

In addition to visiting office hours and completing the recommended readings, there are many other ways in which you can find help on assignments and projects.

The [Data Science and Social Inquiry Lab (DASIL)](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/resources/data-inquiry-lab) is staffed by mentors who are experienced in `R` programming and may be able to troubleshoot coding problems you are having.  Many students who've successfully completed this course have made extensive use of the DASIL work space and its computing resources.

The online platform [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is a useful resource to find user-generated coding solutions to common `R` problems.  Nearly all professional data scientists have needed to "look up" a coding strategy on a site like Stack Overflow at some point in their career, and I have no problem with you doing the same on assignments or projects.  However, if you make substantial use of a Stack Overflow answer (ie: actually integrating lines of code written by someone else into your work, not just getting help identifying the right functions/arguments) the expectation is that you cite or acknowledge doing so.
