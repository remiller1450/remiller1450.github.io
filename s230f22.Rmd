### Syllabus

Welcome to the course website for Sta-230, Introduction to Data Science. To begin, you can find the course syllabus linked below:

- [Click here](syllabus230f22.html) to view the course syllabus

You can locate course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left.  

Please note: material will not be posted until we've reached that point in the course.

### Labs

Sta-230 uses a *workshop style* class format. This means that the majority of our class time will be devoted towards collaboratively working through guided lab activities. You should consult the syllabus for a more detailed description of procedures related to labs.

- [Project #1 - Data Visualization](s230f22/project1.html)
    - Friday 9/9 by 11:59pm - partners and proposals
    - Wednesday 9/21 and Friday 9/23 - in-class work sessions and meetings
    - Friday 9/23 by 11:59pm - post on P-web
    - Monday 9/26 by 11:59pm - post peer reviews on P-web
