### Syllabus

Welcome to the course website for Sta-230, Introduction to Data Science. To begin, you can find the course syllabus linked below:

- [Click here](syllabus230f22.html) to view the course syllabus

You can locate course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left.  

Please note: material will not be posted until we've reached that point in the course.

### Labs

Sta-230 uses a *workshop style* class format. This means that the majority of our class time will be devoted towards collaboratively working through guided lab activities. You should consult the syllabus for a more detailed description of procedures related to labs.

### Projects

There will be 3 projects throughout the semester. Tentative dates for these projects can be found below:

- [Project #1 - Data Visualization](s230f22/project1.html)
    - Date TBD - work session and meetings
    - Date TBD - post final product on P-web
- Project #2 - R Shiny
    - Information coming soon
- Project #3 - Model-based Data Analysis
    - Information coming soon

*Please note*: these projects do not contribute equally to your final grade. Project #1 is only 5% of your overall grade, making it worth only slightly more than a homework assignment (each worth ~3%)

### Datasets

Links and brief descriptions of the data sets we will use during the semester can be found below:
