<img style="float: right;" src="running.jpg"> I'm originally from the northwest suburbs of Chicago, which is also where I met my wife Alissa.  We've both lived the midwest for our entire lives in various locations across Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin.

In my younger days I was competitive in many sports, and I enjoy lifting weights and running outdoors during my leisure time.  I was a varisity cross country runner at Augustana College and, while I'm not nearly as fast as I used to be, I still enjoy running a race or two each year.  The picture of me comes from the [2017 Sno-fun-run](http://racinearearunningclub.org/s-no-w-fun-run/), a race I've ran with old cross country teammates every January for the last 6 years.

Some of my other hobbies include: listening to music, my favorite songs include: ["Ocean Avenue"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9fLbfzCqWw), ["Mr. Brightside"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE), and ["I'm Ready"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1_WMPFaq-4), doing crossword puzzles, playing trivia, following the Green Bay Packers and Iowa Hawkeyes, and watching documentaries or true crime shows like Forensic Files.
