### In-class Labs

Throughout the semester we will practice applying key concepts in applications involving real data during in-class labs.  During labs, you will work collaboratively in a group of 2-3 students to progress through a guided data analysis.  You will have the majority of class to work independently with your group, and we will will often go over a few key questions towards the end of class.  Your group will be expected to turn-in a lab write-up.

- Lab #1 - Summarizing Data
