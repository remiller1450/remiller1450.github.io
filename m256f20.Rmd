Variables include: demographic characteristics of the shooter, information on when/where the shooting occurred, information on the number of victims, and information about the mental health status of the shooter.
- [Tailgating and Drug Use](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Tailgating.csv) 
    - Participants were recruited based upon their self-reported drug use and asked to follow an erratically behaving lead vehicle as part of a driving simulator experiment under the working hypothesis that regular users of certain drugs would exhibit more risky driving behavior.  The data were derived from a study conducted by the National Advanced Driving Simulator organization.
