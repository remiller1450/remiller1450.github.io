```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#-	Intro
#	Keep as-is
#-	Pop and Samples
#	Keep as-is
#-	Do Lab #1 (descriptive stats, update lab)
#-	Correlation, association, and causation
#	Need to create
#-	Do Lab #2 (Florida death penalty, update but mostly good)
#-	Randomized Experiments
#	Mostly okay
#-	Interval Estimation Part I (Sampling Distributions)
#	Need to make/update
#-	Interval Estimation Part II (Bootstrapping)
#	Need to make/update
#-	Lab #3 (bootstrapping, mostly okay)
#-	Interval Estimation Part III (Normal Approximations)
#	Need to make/update
#	1 prop -> 2 prop -> 1 mean -> 2 means, but quick
#-	Lab #4 (confidence intervals, need to make, include confounding in there and maybe intro to using intervals to do a test?)
#-	Hypothesis Testing Part I (Null Distributions and p-values)
#	Mostly good, might need to update
```

### Datasets

- [Happy Planet](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/HappyPlanet.csv)
    - This dataset was assembled by [The Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org/) using data from a global survey that asks respondents questions about how they feel their lives are going. It documents the health and well-being of the inhabitants of various nations around the world. 
- [Tips](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Tips.csv) 
    - These data were recorded by a waiter in national chain restaurant located in a suburban shopping mall in the early 1990s. The data document various aspects of each table served by the waiter, including the total bill, tip, size of the party, time of day, day of the week, and whether the party included a smoker.  The data were originally obtained from the textbook: *Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis: With R*
- [Iowa City Home Sales](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/IowaCityHomeSales.csv)
    - This dataset contains information on homes sold in Iowa City, IA between 2005 and 2008.  It was scraped from the Johnson County county assessor website, and it contains information such as the home's sale price, assessed value, square footage, and features.  
- [Colleges 2019](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019.csv)
    - This dataset contains select variables describing higher education institutions that primarily bachelors degrees. It was obtained from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive government database.  For each institution, it includes enrollment and admissions variables, student demographics, costs and faculty salaries, as well as student outcomes such as median debt upon graduation and median 10-year salary.
