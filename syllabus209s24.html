<h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
<p>This course aims to develop in students informed critical and
theoretical perspectives on the social impact of data collection,
including the social construction of data production, and the use of
algorithmic techniques to process that data.</p>
<p>In plainer terms, the objective of this course is to prepare students
to independently perform basic data analyses using justifiable
statistical methods.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level4">
<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>After completing this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Utilize data visualization, descriptive statistics, regression, and
statistical inference to derive meaningful insights from data.</li>
<li>Correctly apply the statistical methods of hypothesis testing and
confidence interval estimation to quantify the presence of variability
in data.</li>
<li>Use the <code>R</code> programming environment to create data
visualizations and perform basic statistical analyses.</li>
<li>Clearly and concisely communicate findings to statistical and
non-statistical audiences.</li>

<div id="policies" class="section level3">
<h3>Policies</h3>
<p><strong>Class Sessions</strong></p>
<p>At least 50% of in-class time will be devoted towards “lab”, which
involves working in a group of 2-3 to progress through guided exercises.
You will be responsible for the contents of these labs on exams, so it
essential that you and your partner(s) work together and make certain
that everyone understands each topic in sufficient detail. For most of
the semester lab partners will be assigned, but you will have an
opportunity to select your own partners towards the end of the
semester.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
<p>This course involves substantial collaboration and absences impact
not only yourself, but also your classmates. That said, I understand
that missing class is sometimes necessary. If you will be absent for any
reason I ask to be notified as soon as possible. Showing up late or
missing class without notice will negatively impact the “engagement and
participation” portion of your final grade.</p>
<p><strong>Late Work</strong></p>
<p>Assignments are generally due at 11:59pm on their assigned due-date
(as shown on P-web). All assignments have an automatic 48-hour grace
period where they can still be submitted with no greater than a 10%
penalty applied. After 48-hours, late work may still be accepted on a
case-by-case basis subject to an additional penalty. Special exceptions
due to individual circumstances may be possible, but should be arranged
in advance of an assignment’s deadline, and/or coordinated with Grinnell
College academic support staff.</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>Software is an essential piece of modern applications of statistics
and will play an important role in this course. We will primarily use
<code>R</code>, an open-source statistical software program. You will
also be expected to write, document, and submit code used for projects
and assignments throughout the semester.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use your own personal laptop, or a Grinnell
College laptop, during the course. <code>R</code> is freely available
and you can download it and it’s UI companion, <code>R Studio</code>,
here (note: <code>R</code> must be downloaded and installed before
<code>R Studio</code>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download <code>R</code> from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"
class="uri">http://www.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>Download <code>R Studio</code> from <a
href="http://www.rstudio.com/"
class="uri">http://www.rstudio.com/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>You may also work on a classroom laptop, all of which will have
<code>R</code> and <code>R Studio</code> pre-installed.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are welcome to use Grinnell’s online version of R
Studio: <a href="https://rstudio.grinnell.edu/"
class="uri">https://rstudio.grinnell.edu/</a></p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>
<p>At Grinnell College you are part of a conversation among scholars,
professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual
community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and
writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you
submit-all these are ways you participate in this conversation.</p>
<p>The College presumes that your work for any course is your own
contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to take
responsibility for that contribution. That is, you should strive to
present ideas and data fairly and accurately, indicate what is your own
work, and acknowledge what you have derived from others. This care
permits other members of the community to trace the evolution of ideas
and check claims for accuracy.</p>
<p>Failure to live up to this expectation constitutes academic
dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is misrepresenting someone’s
intellectual effort as your own. Within the context of a course, it also
can include misrepresenting your own work as produced for that class
when in fact it was produced for some other purpose. Additional
information <a
href="https://www.grinnell.edu/about/leadership/offices-services/academic-advising/resources">can
be found here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusive Classroom</strong></p>
<p>Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with
documented disabilities. To receive accommodations, students must
provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources,
information <a
href="http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services">can
be found here</a>. If you plan on using accommodations in this course,
you should speak with me as early as possible in the semester so that we
can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Holidays</strong></p>
<p>Grinnell College encourages students who plan to observe holy days
that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult
with your instructor in the first three weeks of classes so that you may
reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your
religious observance, and the requirements of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Support</strong></p>
<p>If you have other needs not addressed in previous sections, please
let me know soon so that we can work together for the best possible
learning environment. In some cases, I will recommend consulting with
the Academic Advising staff. They are an excellent resource for
developing strategies for academic success and can connect you with
other campus resources as well: <a
href="http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising"
class="uri">http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising</a>.
If I notice that you are encountering difficulty, in addition to
communicating with you directly about it, I will also likely submit an
academic alert via Academic Advising’s SAL portal. This reminds you of
my concern, and it notifies the Academic Advising team and your
adviser(s) so that they can reach out to you with additional offers of
support.</p>

</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p><strong>Engagement and Participation</strong> - 5%</p>
<p>Participation in a lab-heavy course is absolutely critical. During
labs you are expected to help your partner(s) learn the material (which
goes beyond simply answering the lab questions), and your partner is
expected to help further your understanding. Everyone will begin the
semester with a baseline participation score of 80%, which will move up
or down depending on my subjective assessment of your behavior during
class. You can very quickly raise this score by helping your lab
partner(s), and working diligently to understand course material during
class. Alternatively, you can lower this score by skipping class,
letting your lab partner(s) do most of the work, using your phone or
surfing the web during class, etc. If you are ever unsure of your
participation standing, you can email me and I am happy to provide you
an interim estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong> - 10%</p>
<p>In-class labs contain embedded questions that you and your lab
partner(s) will answer together. Some lab questions will be scored for
accuracy with feedback given, while others may be scored for
effort/completion. Additionally, labs are to be completed
collaboratively, and if it becomes clear that you are your partner(s)
are using a “divide and conquer” approach to answering lab questions
your score on that assignment will be penalized.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Homework</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>There will be approximately 10 homework assignments throughout the
semester, generally with one assignment due each week (with some
exceptions around exam dates). Homework is to be completed individually,
and answers that are suspiciously similar may be reported as academic
honesty violations. That said, I recognize that you may want to check-in
with classmates on homework questions, and you are welcome to do this so
long as your submitted answers are uniquely your own and you acknowledge
the contributions of anyone or anything (other than official course
materials, instructors, and mentors) that substantively shaped your
answers.</p>
<p><strong>Exams (3x)</strong> - 45% in total</p>
<p>There will be 2 midterms and a final exam. Each midterm will focus on
a specific set of content, but because course topics are naturally
cumulative there may be some questions involving earlier content. The
final exam will be cumulative.</p>
<p>The 3 exams will contribute 14%, 14%, and 17% towards your
end-of-semester grade, with your <em>highest</em> exam score (of the 3)
contributing 17% and the other exams each contributing 14%.</p>
<p>Exams may contain open-notes sections involving the use of a computer
(R Studio) as well as closed-notes sections (formulas will be provided
as necessary).</p>
<p><strong>Project</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>The course project is intended to provide you an opportunity to
perform your own statistical analysis on real-world data. The final
product is a three-page written report accompanied by R code and
documentation. You may work on this project <em>individually</em>, or in
a <em>group of two or three</em> of your choosing. This project is
intended to mirror the <a
href="https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usclap">USCLAP Competition</a>
guidelines, and I encourage any interested students to prepare their
project with a competition submission in-mind.</p>
<p>There will be several project check-points throughout the semester,
and a comprehensive description of the assignment will be made available
later in the semester.</p>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<p><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to visiting office hours and completing the recommended
readings, there are many other ways in which you can find help on
assignments and projects.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/resources/data-inquiry-lab">Data
Science and Social Inquiry Lab (DASIL)</a> is staffed by mentors who are
experienced in <code>R</code> programming and may be able to
troubleshoot coding problems you are having.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/math/math-lab">Grinnell
Math Lab</a> is located on the 2nd floor of Noyce Science Center in Room
2012 and offers drop-in statistics tutoring.</p>
<p>The online platform <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">Stack Overflow</a>
is a useful resource to find user-generated coding solutions to common
<code>R</code> problems. Nearly all professionals have needed to “look
up” a coding strategy on a site like Stack Overflow at some point in
their career, and I have no problem with you doing the same on
assignments or projects. However, if you make substantial use of a Stack
Overflow answer (ie: actually integrating lines of code written by
someone else into your work, not just getting help identifying the right
functions/arguments) the expectation is that you cite or acknowledge
doing so.</p>
