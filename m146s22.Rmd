### In-class Labs

Throughout the semester we will practice applying key concepts in applications involving real data during in-class labs.  During labs, you will work collaboratively in a group of 2-3 students to progress through a guided data analysis.  You will have the majority of class to work independently with your group, and we will will often go over a few key questions towards the end of class.  Your group will be expected to turn-in a lab write-up.

### Datasets

Dataset links and descriptions will be added here as we use them throughout the semester.

- [Happy Planet](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/HappyPlanet.csv)
    - This dataset was assembled by [The Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org/) using data from a global survey that asks respondents questions about how they feel their lives are going. It documents the health and well-being of the inhabitants of various nations around the world.
- [Breast Cancer](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Breast_Cancer_Data.csv)
    - These data document the survival times women who died of breast from their diagnoses. They are a subset of a broader dataset that included survivors.  In addition to survival time, the data also include tumor measurements, grades, and other clinical covariates that might be predictive of survival.
- [Colleges 2019](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019_Complete.csv)
    - This dataset contains select variables describing higher education institutions that primarily bachelors degrees. It was obtained from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive government database.  For each institution, it includes enrollment and admissions variables, student demographics, costs and faculty salaries, as well as student outcomes such as median debt upon graduation and median 10-year salary.
- [Ohio Counties 2021](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/OH_health21.csv)
    - These data were obtained from the Ohio department of health. They document various health-related outcomes at the county level for the year 2021.  Additional information and a download link for the full datafile can be found here: https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/ohio/2020/downloads
- [Resting Metabolism](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/RMR.csv)
    - These data contain the resting metabolic rates and body weights of 44 adult women. The dataset appears in the textbook "Practical Statistics for Medical Research".
- [Death Penalty Sentencing](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/DeathPenaltySentencing.csv)
    - This dataset comes from a [widely cited study](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12039&context=journal_articles) on racially biased sentencing in the Florida court system during the 1970s. Researchers collected data on all murders that took place during a felony committed in the state of Florida between 1972 and 1977.  They record the race of the victim and the offender, as well as whether the offered was sentenced to the death penalty.
    - [Here is a subset of cases where the victim was White](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/DeathPenaltyWhiteVic.csv)
    - [Here is a subset of cases where the victim was Black](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/DeathPenaltyBlackVic.csv)
