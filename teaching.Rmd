Throughout my career I've taught numerous courses in mathematics, statistics, and data science in a variety of settings.  Information on the courses I've taught can be found below.

### MATH-156 - General Statistics - Xavier University

MATH-156 is a course intended for non-math majors that provides an introduction to the concepts and tools used for collecting, analyzing, and making inferences from data. Topics include: graphical displays, correlation, regression, design of experiments, probability, simulation, random sampling, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

### MATH-256 - Intro to Probability and Statistics - Xavier University

MATH-256 is a calculus-based introduction to probability and descriptive and inferential statistics. Topics include numerical and graphical summaries of data, conditional probability, Bernoulli trials, normal distribution, the central limit theorem, estimation, t-tests, chi-square tests, type I and II errors, regression and correlation.

### STA-209 - Applied Statistics - Grinnell College

STA-209 is an introductory course in applied statistics covering topics including: data collection, visualization, summary statistics, basic statistical inference for one and two samples, linear regression (simple and multiple), one- and two-way ANOVA, and categorical data analysis.  The class involves several comprehensive labs that guide students through the analysis of real data using Minitab and StatKey software.

### STA-230 - Introduction to Data Science - Grinnell College

STA-230 introduces core topics in data science using the R programming langauge. The course covers data cleaning, merging, exploration, visualization, modeling, and other topics using guided labs and case studies in a workshop style classroom.  Materials from the most recent version of the course are provided below, many of these materials were created by Shonda Kuiper (Grinnell College), Adam Loy (Lawrence University), and Laura Chihara (Carleton College) under ACM and Teagle foundation grants.  See the 2017 USCOTS [Data Science for Statistics webpage](https://ds4stats.github.io/uscots2017/) or Shonda Kuiper's [R Tutorials webpage](http://web.grinnell.edu/individuals/kuipers/stat2labs/RTutorials.html) for details.

### STA-395/MAT-395 - Applied Data Science - Grinnell College

STA-395/MAT-395 is a fully applied course where students work in small teams on a semester long, data-intensive project.  The overarching goal of this course is to prepare students to successfully navigate an applied data science project involving working on a team to answer questions posed by an external client.

### BIOS-4120 - Introduction to Biostatistics - University of Iowa

BIOS-4120 is an introductory statistics course that covers basic statistical concepts and methods that are frequently used in medicine, public health, and the biological sciences.  Some topics covered include study design, descriptive statistics, basic rules of probability, measures of association, hypothesis testing for one and two sample continuous and categorical data, confidence intervals, correlation, and an introduction to regression.

### Calculus I, Algebra II with Trig, Algebra I - Pawnee High School (IL)

At the high school level I've taught: Calc I - covering limits, derivatives/anti-derivatives, finding minima and maxima, and applications; Algebra II with Trig - covering functions, graphs, exponents and logarithms, and trigonometry; Algebra I - covering order of operations, equations, and inequalities.
