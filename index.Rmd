<img style="float: right; width:30%; height:30%;" src="pphoto.jpg"> Welcome to my website! I'm currently an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [Grinnell College Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/areas/math-stats).

I've previously worked as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Xavier University Math Deparment](https://www.xavier.edu/mathematics-department/index), and as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [Grinnell College Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/areas/math-stats) where I taught classes in statistics and data science.

My graduate training is in [Biostatistics](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/biostat/), and I completed my PhD at the University of Iowa in August of 2018. As an undergraduate I studied Mathematics at [Augustana College](https://www.augustana.edu/) in Rock Island, Illinois.
