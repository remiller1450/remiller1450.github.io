I am a currently a faculty member in the Grinnell College [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/areas/math-stats) where I teach classes in statistics and data science.  

Prior to joining Grinnell I studied [Biostatistics](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/biostat/) at the University of Iowa, completing my PhD in the summer of 2018.  Before that I studied Mathematics at [Augustana College](https://www.augustana.edu/) in Rock Island Illinois.
