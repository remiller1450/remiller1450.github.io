### In-class Labs

Throughout the semester we will practice applying key concepts in applications involving real data during in-class labs.  During labs, you will work collaboratively in a group of 2-3 students to progress through a guided data analysis.  You will have the majority of class to work independently with your group, and we will will often go over a few key questions towards the end of class.  Your group will be expected to turn-in a lab write-up.

- Lab #1 - [Summarizing and graphing data](m146f21/Lab1.html)
    - Due Date: Wednesday 8/25 by 11:59pm
- Lab #2 - [Correlation and regression](m146f21/Lab2.html)

- Lab #3 - [Confounding variables](m146f21/Lab3.html)
    - Due Date: Friday 9/10 by 11:59pm
- Lab #4 - [Confidence intervals and bootstrapping](m146f21/Lab4.html)
    - Due Date: Monday 9/27 by 11:59pm
- Lab #5 - Null distributions and randomization tests
    - Due Date: TBD

- Week 1: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
- Week 2: 2.5, 2.6
- Week 3: 2.7
- Week 4: 1.2, 1.3

- More information will be provided after Exam #2

### Datasets

Dataset links and descriptions will be added here as we use them throughout the semester.

- [Happy Planet](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/HappyPlanet.csv)
    - This dataset was assembled by [The Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org/) using data from a global survey that asks respondents questions about how they feel their lives are going. It documents the health and well-being of the inhabitants of various nations around the world.
- [Breast Cancer Survival](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Breast_Cancer_Data.csv)
    - These data document the survival times women who died of breast from their diagnoses. They are a subset of a broader dataset that included survivors.  In addition to survival time, the data also include tumor measurements, grades, and other clinical covariates that might be predictive of survival.
- [Colleges 2019](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019_Complete.csv)
    - This dataset contains select variables describing higher education institutions that primarily bachelors degrees. It was obtained from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive government database.  For each institution, it includes enrollment and admissions variables, student demographics, costs and faculty salaries, as well as student outcomes such as median debt upon graduation and median 10-year salary.
- [Infant Heart Surgery](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/InfantHeart.csv)
    - This dataset contains the results of a randomized experiment conducted by surgeons at Harvard Medical School to compare a "low-flow bypass" and "circulatory arrest" surgical approaches in the treatment of infants born with congenital heart defects. The outcomes recorded are Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), a composite score measuring physiological development, with higher scores indicating greater development, and Mental Development Index (MDI), a composite score measuring mental development, with higher scores indicating greater development. 
- [TSA Claims](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/tsa_small.csv)
    - This dataset is a random sample of 5,000 claims made against the Transport Security Administration (TSA) between 2003 and 2008.  It contains information such as the claim type, claim amount, status, and settlement amount.
