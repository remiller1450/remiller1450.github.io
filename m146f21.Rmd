### In-class Labs

Throughout the semester we will practice applying key concepts in applications involving real data during in-class labs.  During labs, you will work collaboratively in a group of 2-3 students to progress through a guided data analysis.  You will have the majority of class to work independently with your group, and we will will often go over a few key questions towards the end of class.  Your group will be expected to turn-in a lab write-up.

- Week 1: Introduction
- Week 2: Data exploration 

### Recommended Readings

The readings listed below are *recommended* prior to attending class during the week indicated. It has been my observation that students who take time to read the textbook, in addition to the required coursework, have been the most successful.
