<p><strong>Course Description</strong>:</p>
<p>The course covers the application of basic statistical methods such
as univariate graphics and summary statistics, basic statistical
inference for one and two samples, linear regression (simple and
multiple), one- and two-way ANOVA, and categorical data analysis.
Students use statistical software to analyze data and conduct
simulations. A student who takes Statistics 209 cannot receive credit
for Mathematics 115 or Social Studies 115. Prerequisite: Mathematics 124
or 131</p>
<p><strong>Texts</strong>:</p>
<p>There is no required textbook for the course.</p>
<p>Select homework exercises, supplemental readings, and other materials
will be drawn from the following sources:</p>

<h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
<p>This course aims to develop in students informed critical and
theoretical perspectives on the impacts of data collection and analysis,
including the social construction of data production, and the use of
algorithmic techniques to process that data.</p>
<p>Put simply, the goal of this course is to prepare students to
independently analyze data using justifiable statistical methods while
understanding both the strengths and limitations of the data and the
analytic methods used.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level4">
<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>After completing this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Utilize data visualization, descriptive statistics, regression, and
statistical inference to derive meaningful insights from data.</li>
<li>Correctly apply the statistical methods of hypothesis testing and
confidence interval estimation to quantify the presence of variability
in data.</li>
<li>Use the <code>R</code> programming environment to create data
visualizations and perform basic statistical analyses.</li>
<li>Clearly and concisely communicate findings to statistical and
non-statistical audiences.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="policies" class="section level3">
<h3>Policies</h3>
<p><strong>Class Sessions</strong></p>
<p>We aim to devote at 50% of in-class time towards “lab”, which
involves working as part of a small group (2-3 students) through
tutorials and exercises involving the analysis of data using
<code>R</code>. For the first half of the semester lab groups will be
assigned, and for the second half you will work on labs with the members
of your class project group.</p>
<p>Content from these labs will appear on exams, so you are responsible
for ensuring that you understand the core concepts introduced in each
lab. Labs are intended to be worked on collaboratively, and use of
“divide and conquer” approaches to answering the lab’s questions may
negatively impact your grade.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
<p>This course involves substantial collaboration and absences impact
not only yourself, but also your classmates, especially if the absence
was not communicated in advance. However, I understand that missing
class is sometimes necessary. If you will be absent for any reason I ask
to be notified as soon as possible. Showing up late or missing class
without notice will negatively impact the “engagement and participation”
portion of your final grade.</p>
<p><strong>Late Work</strong></p>
<p>Assignments are generally due at 11:59pm on the posted due-date. All
deadlines have an automatic 48-hour “partial extension” where I will
accept your submission with a penalty of no more 10% (ie: a penalty
between 0% and 10% depending upon the circumstances and frequency of
late work). After 48-hours, late work may still be accepted on a
case-by-case basis, potentially subject to a penalty greater than 10%.
Special exceptions involving individual circumstances and unexpected
events may be allowed, but they should be arranged as far in advance of
an assignment’s deadline as is possible, and/or coordinated with
academic support staff.</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>Software is an essential tool of statisticians and will play an
important role in this course. We will primarily use <code>R</code>, an
open-source statistical software program created by and for
statisticians. You will also be expected to write, document, and submit
code used on assignments and a course project. You will not be expected
to <em>write</em> any code on exams, but you will be expected to
<em>interpret</em> code and output that is provided.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use your own personal laptop, or a Grinnell
College laptop. <code>R</code> is freely available and you can download
it and it’s UI companion, <code>R Studio</code>, here (note:
<code>R</code> must be downloaded and installed before
<code>R Studio</code>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download <code>R</code> from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"
class="uri">http://www.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>Download <code>R Studio</code> from <a
href="http://www.rstudio.com/"
class="uri">http://www.rstudio.com/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>You may also work on a classroom laptop, all of which will have
<code>R</code> and <code>R Studio</code> pre-installed.</p>
<p>Finally, Grinnell hosts an online version of R Studio that you may
use while on campus internet: <a href="https://rstudio.grinnell.edu/"
class="uri">https://rstudio.grinnell.edu/</a></p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>
<p>At Grinnell College you are part of a conversation among scholars,
professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual
community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and
writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you
submit-all these are ways you participate in this conversation.</p>
<p>The College presumes that your work for any course is your own
contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to take
responsibility for that contribution. That is, you should strive to
present ideas and data fairly and accurately, indicate what is your own
work, and acknowledge what you have derived from others. This care
permits other members of the community to trace the evolution of ideas
and check claims for accuracy.</p>
<p>Failure to live up to this expectation constitutes academic
dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is misrepresenting someone’s
intellectual effort as your own. Within the context of a course, it also
can include misrepresenting your own work as produced for that class
when in fact it was produced for some other purpose. Additional
information <a
href="https://www.grinnell.edu/about/leadership/offices-services/academic-advising/resources">can
be found here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusive Classroom</strong></p>
<p>Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with
documented disabilities. To receive accommodations, students must
provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources,
information <a
href="http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services">can
be found here</a>. If you plan on using accommodations in this course,
you should speak with me as early as possible in the semester so that we
can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Holidays</strong></p>
<p>Grinnell College encourages students who plan to observe holy days
that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult
with your instructor in the first three weeks of classes so that you may
reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your
religious observance, and the requirements of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Support</strong></p>
<p>If you have other needs not addressed in previous sections, please
let me know soon so that we can work together for the best possible
learning environment. In some cases, I will recommend consulting with
the Academic Advising staff. They are an excellent resource for
developing strategies for academic success and can connect you with
other campus resources as well: <a
href="http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising"
class="uri">http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising</a>.
If I notice that you are encountering difficulty, in addition to
communicating with you directly about it, I will also likely submit an
academic alert via Academic Advising’s SAL portal. This reminds you of
my concern, and it notifies the Academic Advising team and your
adviser(s) so that they can reach out to you with additional offers of
support.</p>

<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p><strong>Engagement and Participation</strong> - 5%</p>
<p>Participation in a lab-heavy course is absolutely critical. During
labs you are expected to help your partner(s) learn the material (which
goes beyond simply answering the lab questions), and your partner is
expected to help further your understanding. Everyone will begin the
semester with a baseline participation score of 80%, which will move up
or down depending on my subjective assessment of your behavior during
class. You can very quickly raise this score by helping your lab
partner(s), and working diligently to understand course material during
class. Alternatively, you can lower this score by skipping class,
letting your lab partner(s) do most of the work, using your phone or
surfing the web during class, etc. Reports from lab or project partners
that you are not contributing equally to group efforts may also
influence this score. If you are ever unsure of your participation
standing, you can email me and I am happy to provide you an interim
estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong> - 10%</p>
<p>In-class labs contain embedded questions that you and your lab
partner(s) should answer together in a single document. Some lab
questions will be scored for accuracy with feedback given, while others
may be scored for effort/completion. Additionally, labs are to be
completed collaboratively, and if it becomes clear that you are your
partner(s) are using a “divide and conquer” approach to answering lab
questions your score on that assignment may be penalized.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Homework</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>There will be approximately 10 homework assignments throughout the
semester, generally with one assignment due each week (with some
exceptions around exam dates). Homework is to be completed individually,
and answers that are suspiciously similar may be reported as academic
honesty violations. That said, I understand that you may want to discuss
homework questions with your classmates. You are welcome to do this so
long as your submitted answers are uniquely yours, and if you receive
substantial help you acknowledge the contributions of anyone or anything
(other than official course materials, instructors, and mentors) that
substantively shaped your answers.</p>
<p><strong>Exams (3x)</strong> - 45% in total (15% each)</p>
<p>There will be 3 exams throughout the semester, each covering 3-4
weeks of course content. Because our course content builds upon itself,
these exams are incidentally cumulative, but the focus will always be on
the most recent set of material. Exams are closed-notes, but you will be
provided a formula page containing content I do not want you to
memorize. You will be given the exam’s formula page as well as a
practice version of the exam at least 1-week prior to the exam date.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mastery Policy</em>: My hope is that everyone thoroughly
understands our course content on a schedule aligned with exam dates;
However, I am more interested in everyone understanding this content
when the course is over, not by a somewhat arbitrary exam date.
Consequently, you will have the opportunity to <em>take a replacement
version of any or all of the course’s 3 exams</em> during our assigned
final exam period for a maximum score of 90% on each exam you re-take.
Please note that the intent of this grade cap is to provide an incentive
for studying for the original exam and not waiting until final’s week.
Replacement exams will be approximately the same duration and difficulty
level as their counterparts. Anyone receiving a score lower than 90% on
an exam is eligible to take the corresponding replacement exam. If you
score lower on the replacement than your original exam the two scores
will be averaged. The intent of this averaging policy is to provide an
incentive for you to thoughtfully prepare for any replacement exams you
opt to take during final’s week rather than deciding to take them on
whim hoping you’ll get a higher score.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>The course project is intended to provide you an opportunity to
perform your own statistical analysis on real-world data. The final
product is a three-page written report accompanied by R code and
documentation. You may work on this project <em>individually</em>, or in
a <em>group of two or three</em> of your choosing. This project is
intended to mirror the <a
href="https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usclap">USCLAP Competition</a>
guidelines, and I encourage any interested students to prepare their
project with a competition submission in-mind.</p>
<p>There will be several project check-points throughout the semester,
and a comprehensive description of the assignment will be made available
later in the semester.</p>

2012 and offers drop-in statistics tutoring.</p>
<p>The online platform <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">Stack Overflow</a>
is a useful resource to find user-generated coding solutions to common
<code>R</code> problems. Nearly all professionals have needed to “look
up” a coding strategy on a site like Stack Overflow at some point in
their career, and I have no problem with you doing the same on
assignments or projects. However, if you make substantial use of a Stack
Overflow answer (ie: actually integrating lines of code written by
someone else into your work, not just getting help identifying the right
functions/arguments) the expectation is that you cite or acknowledge
doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Large Language Models</strong></p>
<p>Large language models, such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-pilot, or Google
Bard, can be useful tools for explaining and fixing errors in your
<code>R</code> code, or helping you understand example code in greater
detail than might havebeen given. You are welcome to use these tools
throughout the course; however, you are ultimately responsible for the
accuracy of any work you submit. <em>Relying upon a large language model
to write for you is risky</em>. The model may hallucinate inaccurate
information or generate text that is superficial and lacking sufficient
detail, I encourage you to read <a
href="https://eriksimpson.sites.grinnell.edu/Connections/Documents/WritingWithLLMs.pdf">Professor
Erik Simpson’s write-up on writing with LLMs</a> to see some reasons why
you shouldn’t lean too heavily on these technologies. Nevertheless,
you’re welcome to use large language models in this course in the same
way you’d use a website like Stack Overflow or a peer mentor.</p>
