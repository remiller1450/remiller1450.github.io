Welcome to the website for Tut-100-20, Data, Decisions, and Uncertainty. This page will contain a schedule and all materials used throughout the semester. The first of these is the syllabus, which is linked below:

- [Click here](syllabusTut23.html) to view the course syllabus

Please note that some material will not be posted until we've reached that point in the course, and the schedule may occasionally be revised as we progress through the semester.

### Schedule (last updated 11/1/23)

Please note:

1. All readings should be done before coming to class on the posted date
2. All assignments should be submitted via P-web unless other directions are given.
3. Dates with a $*$ will begin at 8:30am (rather than 8:00am)
