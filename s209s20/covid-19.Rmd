**Disclaimer**: The following page was most recently updated at 10am on Wednesday 3/11.  It will very likely end up being revised following in-class discussions, directives from Grinnell College administration, and conversations with math department colleagues that will take place this week.

### Items that Mostly Certain

- Lectures will be posted online with audio
- Textbook reading will become required
    - Simple reading quizzes will be required weekly (expire on Fridays at 1pm Grinnell time when HW is due)
    - I'm thinking a few questions that would be nearly impossible to miss if you did the reading
- Homework will continue as usual (due weekly on Fridays at 1pm Grinnell time)
    - Time-sensitive submission links will be added to p-web for all remaining homeworks
- A final project involving some sort of data analysis will be required
    - The presentation component of the final project will be dropped
- Some sort of office hours will be held on a weekly basis
    - I'm expecting the college to issue recommendations here


### Items up for Discussion

- Time-sensitive exams through p-web or take-home exams to be completed over a 24-hour window
    - p-web exams would be accessable whenever you choose during a certain window, but you'd be required to complete them in a single sitting with a 90-minute (180 for the final) time limit
- Option to keep or dissolve your current final project group (with working individually as a new option)
    - Expectations would be higher for group projects relative to individual projects
- Open up discussion boards as another venue for Q+A? (presumably this is better than emailing questions since everyone can see the questions and responses)
- What to do with labs ...
    - Minitab access?
    - Reducing length?
    - Making some questions required and other for extra credit?
    - Working with your project group?
