### General Schedule

Shown below is a generic schedule illustrating how the course will operate for the majority of the semester:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tab <- data.frame(Tues1 = c("Progress briefing presentation (Group 1)", "General questions/comments", "Advisory team meetings", "Goal Setting and Critique"),
                  Thurs1 = c("Progress briefing presentation (Group 2)", "General questions/comments", "Advisory team meetings", "Goal Setting and Critique"),
Tues2 = c("Progress briefing presentation (Group 3)", "General questions/comments", "Advisory team meetings", "Goal Setting and Critique"),
                  Thurs2 = c("Time to work/organize", "-", "-", "-"))

knitr::kable(tab)
```

Explained in words:

- Each day one team will present its progress over the last two-week interval
- The other two groups will serve as advisory teams, preparing a brief report during class
- The class session will conclude with the presenting team sharing its goals for the next two-week interval
- When no group is presenting, class time will be used to make plans, work on the project, or consult with Prof. Miller on technical aspects of the project
