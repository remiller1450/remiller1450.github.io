### Schedule and Syllabus

Welcome to course website for MATH 256 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics!  On this page you can find all materials we'll use throughout the semester, starting with the syllabus linked below:

- [Click here](syllabus256f21.html) to view the course syllabus

You can find course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left. Please note that some material may not be posted until we've reached that point in the course.

### Lectures Slides

- Week 1: [Summarizing data](m256f21/summarizing_data.pdf)
- Week 2: Sampling and study design
- Week 3: nothing new - wrap up old material and practice for Exam #1
- Week 4: Probability
- Week 5: Distributions of random variables
- Week 6: nothing new - wrap up old material and practice for Exam #2

### In-class Labs

Throughout the semester we will practice applying key concepts in applications involving real data during in-class labs.  During labs, you will work collaboratively in a group of 2-3 students to progress through a guided data analysis.  You will have the majority of class to work independently with your group, and we will will often go over a few key questions towards the end of class.  Your group will be expected to turn-in a lab write-up.

- Week 1: [Data basics and an introduction to R](m256f21/Lab1.html)
    - Due date: Friday 8/20 by 11:59pm
- Week 2: [Graphing and summarizing data](m256f21/Lab2.html)
    - Due date: Friday 8/27 by 11:59pm
- Week 3: Exam #1 Practice (real exam on Thursday)
    - The practice exam will not be collected
- Week 4: Probability 
    - Due date: TBD
- Week 5: Simulation studies of random variables
    - Due date: TBD
- Week 6: none (Exam #2 on Thursday)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Week 7 = Central limit theorem
# Week 8 = Inference for one-sample categorical data
# Week 9 = Inference for one-sample quantitative data
# Week 10 = none (Exam #3)
# Week 11 = Two-sample inference
# Week 12 = Chi-squared tests
# Week 13 = ANOVA
# Week 14 = Regression
# Week 15 = none (Exam #4)
# Week 16 = none (time to work on projects)
```

### Recommended Readings

The readings listed below are *recommended* prior to attending class during the week indicated. It has been my observation that students who take time to read the textbook, in addition to the required coursework, have been the most successful.

- Week 1: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2
- Week 2: 1.3, 1.4, 2.3
- Week 3: nothing new, prepare for Exam #1
    
### Homework Assignments

Homework will be assigned approximately every two weeks.  These assignments can be lengthy, so please start them sooner rather than later. Your responses should be submitted electronically via Canvas as either a scanned or typed document.  Please double-check to make sure your uploads are legible.

- Homework #1: 1.2, 1.5, 1.10, 1.14, 1.18, 1.21, 1.28, 1.30, 1.40, 2.28, 2.30, 2.31, 2.34
    - Due Date: Tuesday 8/31 at 11:59pm
    - A brief set of solutions will be posted to Canvas on Wednesday morning (to help you prepare for Exam #1)

### Exam Dates and Information

There will be 4 midterm exams covering the following topics:

- Exam 1 - Descriptive statistics, graphical presentations, and study design (Ch 1 and 2)
- Exam 2 - Probability and random variables (Ch 3 and 4)
- Exam 3 - Statistical inference for one-sample data (Ch 5, 6.1, and 7.1)
- Exam 4 - statistical inference for two or more samples (remaining sections of Ch 6, 7, and 8)

You will be given an entire class period to complete each exam, though I will try to write them to target an average completion time of around 60-minutes.  

With the exception of Exam 2, all exams will "open everything", and will require you to use R.  Exam 2 will be on-paper and closed notes (a small set of formulas will be given).

### Final Project Information

This class contains a final project that is due at the end of the semester (during final's week).

- More information will be made available following Exam #2

### Daily Graphs

Below is a compendium of the various daily graphs we've discussed:

### Datasets

This section provides links and a brief description to datasets we will work with throughout the semester.

- [Iowa City Home Sales](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/IowaCityHomeSales.csv)
    - This dataset contains information on homes sold in Iowa City, IA between 2005 and 2008.  It was scraped from the Johnson County county assessor website by University of Iowa professor to help them understand the local housing market. It contains information such as the home's sale price, assessed value, square footage, and a variety of other features.  
- [Happy Planet](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/HappyPlanet.csv)
    - This dataset was assembled by [The Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org/) using data from a global survey that asks respondents questions about how they feel their lives are going. It documents the health and well-being of the inhabitants of various nations around the world.

- [Colleges 2019](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019.csv)
    - This dataset contains select variables describing higher education institutions that primarily bachelors degrees. It was obtained from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive government database.  For each institution, it includes enrollment and admissions variables, student demographics, costs and faculty salaries, as well as student outcomes such as median debt upon graduation and median 10-year salary.
