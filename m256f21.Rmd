You can find course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left. Please note that some material may not be posted until we've reached that point in the course.

### Lectures Slides

- Week 1: Summarizing data
- Week 2: Sampling and observational designs
- Week 3: Experimental designs

### In-class Labs

Throughout the semester we will practice applying key concepts in applications involving real data during in-class labs.  During labs, you will work collaboratively in a group of 2-3 students to progress through a guided data analysis.  You will have the majority of class to work independently with your group, and we will will often go over a few key questions towards the end of class.  Your group will be expected to turn-in a lab write-up.

- Week 1: [Data basics and an introduction to R](m256f21/Lab1.html)
    - Due date: Friday 8/20 by 11:59pm
- Week 2: Graphing and summarizing data
    - Due date: Friday 8/27 by 11:59pm
- Week 3: none (Exam #1 on Thursday)

### Recommended Readings

The readings listed below are *recommended* prior to attending class during the week indicated. It has been my observation that students who take time to read the textbook, in addition to the required coursework, have been the most successful.

- Week 1: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2
- Week 2: 1.3
- Week 3: 1.4, 2.3
    
### Homework Assignments

Homework will be assigned approximately every two weeks.  These assignments can be lengthy, so please start them sooner rather than later. Your responses should be submitted electronically via Canvas as either a scanned or typed document.  Please double-check to make sure your uploads are legible.

- Homework #1: 1.2, 1.5, 1.10, 1.14, 1.18, 1.21, 1.28, 1.30, 1.40, 2.28, 2.30, 2.31, 2.34
    - Due Date: Tuesday 8/31 at 11:59pm
    - A brief set of solutions will be posted to Canvas on Wednesday morning (to help you prepare for Exam #1)

### Exam Dates and Information

There will be 4 midterm exams covering the following topics:

- Exam 1 - Descriptive statistics, graphical presentations, and study design (Ch 1 and 2)
- Exam 2 - Probability and random variables (Ch 3 and 4)
- Exam 3 - Statistical inference for one-sample data (Ch 5, 6.1, and 7.1)
- Exam 4 - statistical inference for two or more samples (remaining sections of Ch 6, 7, and 8)

You will be given an entire class period to complete each exam, though I will try to write them to target an average completion time of around 60-minutes.  With the exception of Exam 2, all exams will "open everything", and will require you to use R.  Exam 2 will be on-paper and closed notes (a small set of formulas will be given).

### Final Project Information

This class contains a final project that is due at the end of the semester (during final's week).

- More information will be made available following Exam #2

### Datasets

This section provides links and a brief description to datasets we will work with throughout the semester.

- [Iowa City Home Sales](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/IowaCityHomeSales.csv)
