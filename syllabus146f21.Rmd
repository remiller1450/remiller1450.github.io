## Course Description

A first course in statistics, with an emphasis on applications and methods of particular relevance to the biological sciences. Topics include: random sampling procedures, experiments and observational studies, exploratory data analysis, correlation, bootstrapping and resampling methods, the normal distribution, confidence intervals hypothesis tests for proportions and means, chi-square tests, ANOVA. Problems and examples are drawn from fields such as bioinformatics, genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and public health.

### Text

This course will follow the textbook listed below.  Homework problems will be assigned weekly from the text, readings are optional (though strongly encouraged).

- *Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data* - 3rd edition (ISBN: 9781119682165)

### Website

- All course materials will be posted on the following website: https://remiller1450.github.io/m146fs21.html
    - Our Canvas page will used for grades, assignment submissions, and links

### Course Aims:

This course intends to develop in students an ability to identify and understand patterns in data using visualizations and statistical methods.  It will focus on developing a clear understanding of fundamental statistical techniques, proper interpretation of statistical results, and clear communication of these ideas in both written and oral formats.

### Learning Objectives:

Specific learning outcomes, with respect to the core curriculum at Xavier, include:

- (1a) Students recognize and cogently discuss significant questions in the humanities, arts, and
the natural and social sciences
- (2a) Students find, evaluate, and logically convey information and ideas in written and oral
form
- (2b) Students evaluate problems using quantitative methods and arguments

### Software

In the modern era, statisticians (along with most other scientific professionals) rely extensively on software in their day to day work. While the topics of this course are not focused on any particular software package, you can expect to routinely use Microsoft Excel and online web-applets to explore and analyze real data.

## Grading

**Homework** - 20%

- Roughly 10-12 problem sets 

Homework is assigned weekly (with some exceptions during exam weeks) and is to be submitted electronically via Canvas no later than 11:59pm on the specified due-date.

**Labs** - 15%

- Roughly 8-10 lab write-ups 

Labs are collaborate activities intended to be completed during class in small groups.  We will often go over key lab questions as a class prior to when the lab write-up is due.  The intent of requiring you to turn in these write-ups is to keep you accountable for the material covered during labs.  That is, if your group is putting forth an earnest effort you can expect a high score, even if you don't initially get every detail fully correct.

Group members that are non-cooperate or do not adequately contribute their group's efforts may receive lower scores than the other group members.

**Exams** - 48% (in total)

- Exam 1 - 12%
- Exam 2 - 12%
- Exam 3 - 12%
- Exam 4 - 12%

All exams will be announced at least 14 calendar days in advance. Formulas will be provided as necessary, you may choose to bring your own calculator (not necessary).  Exams 1 and 2 will be closed notes and completed via paper and pencil, while exams 3 and 4 will require a computer (and therefore will be open notes).

These exams are intended to test how deeply you understand the key concepts of the course, they are not meant to test memorization or arithmetic skills.  Consequently, you should be prepared for a substantial amount of writing during exams.

**Final Project** - 17% (in total)

- Intermediate Steps - 2%
- Final Report - 15%

Rather than a traditional final exam, this class has a comprehensive project where you will be expected to demonstrate your newly developed statistical prowess on an application of your choosing.  Additional information will come towards the end of the semester. You will have the option to work alone or with a partner of your choosing on this project.

### Overall Course Grades

The following grade cutoffs will be used:

- A [93,100]
- A- [90, 93)
- B+ [87, 90)
- B [83, 87)
- B- [80, 83)
- C+ [77, 80)
- C [73, 77)
- C- [70, 73)
- D+ [67, 70)
- D [63, 67)
- D- [60, 63)
- F [0, 60)

The course instructor reserves the right to adjust these thresholds *downward*, but *not upward* at the end of the semester.  

## Policies

In accordance with the values of Xavier University, students are expected to adhere to the following policies:

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled lectures assigned to them.  The instructor reserves the right to lower final course grades in response to repeated, unexcused absences.  Good attendance means more than simply showing up to class, please practice proper etiquette including not being late, refraining from cell-phone use during class, respecting your classmates, and actively participating in class activities to your fullest capacity.

### Attending the Class Virtually

In the event of personal circumstances that prevent you from physically attending your in-person session, you may be able attend class via Zoom provided you communicate your situation in advance and receive instructor approval.  Please note, this class is not designed to be attended remotely.

### Academic Honesty

Students are expected to abide by the academic honesty code set forth by Xavier University.  Any suspected violations will be reported and investigated.

In general, collaborate work on all assignments (other than exams) highly encouraged in this course, but you are individually responsible for your submitted work.  Copying solutions word-for-word from anyone or any source without full disclosure is considered cheating.  If you received help, ideas, or inspiration from anywhere (classmates, online resources, etc.) I strongly encourage you to indicate this on your assignment (a simple statement like "Worked with Jack and Jill" is enough).

### Late Assignments

Late work may be accepted on a case-by-case basis.  If accepted, you must provide an email record of your late submission.  This can be an email saying you uploaded the assignment late on Canvas, or an email containing the assignment as an attachment.  The purpose of this policy is to ensure all accepted late work is counted towards your grade and does not end up being lost or overlooked.

### Campus Resources

The Math Lab staffs tutors that are specifically intended to provide help 100-level mathematics courses, including this one.  Please visit the [Math Lab website](https://www.xavier.edu/mathematics-department/math-lab) for hours and additional information (such as when statistics tutors are available).

The Student Support Center has a wide variety of available resources that are not specific to this course but may be beneficial to your overall academic successful.  For more information, visit the [Student Success Center website](https://www.xavier.edu/success/success-coaching/index).

## Tips for Success

1. The material we cover this semester is naturally cumulative and it will be difficult to progress through the later topics if you do not fully understand the earlier ones.  You should be proactive in asking questions, reviewing your notes, and doing the recommended readings - especially at the beginning of the semester.  I also encourage you to visit the Math Lab at least once prior to the first exam.
2. Prepare for class and complete assignments while the material is fresh - avoid waiting until right before the due-date.  This will also enable you to ask good questions during class that will strengthen your understand.
3. Try your best to be open-minded and think like a statistician while engaging with course material.  Nearly all of us have tendencies and biases that influence our thought process, but a statistician should analyze the data objectively without injecting their own subjective beliefs (unless prompted to do so).  Additionally, statisticians are not mathematicians, so don't sabotage yourself by thinking things like "I don't like math..." or "I've always been bad at math..."
