You can locate course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left.

## Course Materials

Most class meetings involve both lecture and lab components.  Topics are grouped into units, which can be found below.  Assignments are generally due at the end of a unit, but I encourage you to complete them as they are made available.

### Unit #1 

**Overview, Introductory Python, and Unsupervised Learning**:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
# x <- cars[1:3,]
# urls <- c("stackoverflow.com", "stats.stackexchange.com", "homebrew.stackexchange.com")
# linkID <- c("link1", "link2", "link3")
# x$website <- paste0("[", linkID, "](http://", urls, ")")
# kable(x)

x = data.frame(Date = c("1/23", "1/25", "1/30", "2/1"), 
               Lecture = c("[Introduction and k-means](ml24/intro.pdf)", "[Hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN](ml24/clust.pdf)", " ", "Principal Component Analysis"),
               Lab = c("[Lab 1 - Python Foundations and k-means](ml24/intro_clustering.html)", "[Lab 2 - Clustering and Outlier Detection](ml24/more_clustering.html)", " ", "Lab 3 - Principal Component Analysis"))
kable(x) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover"))
```

**Assignments**:

- Labs 1, 2, and 3 are due Friday 2/2 by 11:59pm
    - Please submit an Jupyter Notebook containing all code and written responses
- [Homework 1](ml24/hw1.pdf) due Tuesday 2/6 by 1:00pm
