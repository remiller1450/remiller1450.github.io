### Schedule and Syllabus

Welcome to Sta-209, Applied Statistics!  On this page you can find all of the materials we'll use during the semester, starting with the syllabus linked below:

- [Click here](syllabus209f19.html) to view the course syllabus

To see when and how we'll use these materials please visit the schedule page linked below:

- [Click here](tabs209f19.html) to view the course schedule

You can find course content by scrolling, or by using the navigation bar in the upper left. Please note:

1. Occansionally I will not post a lecture in advance, this is usually because it contains some type of "surprise" that I don't want you to see ahead of time.
2. Links may not become active until we've reached the appropriate point in the course, so if you get a "404 page not found" error it is likely because haven't gotten to that topic yet.
3. Predicting far into the future can be inaccurate, so some details like due dates are subject to change as we get closer to a topic/assignment. You should consult the schedule page to see official due dates.

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#-	Intro
#	Keep as-is
#-	Pop and Samples
#	Keep as-is
#-	Do Lab #1 (descriptive stats, update lab)
#-	Correlation, association, and causation
#	Need to create
#-	Do Lab #2 (Florida death penalty, update but mostly good)
#-	Randomized Experiments
#	Mostly okay
#-	Interval Estimation Part I (Sampling Distributions)
#	Need to make/update
#-	Interval Estimation Part II (Bootstrapping)
#	Need to make/update
#-	Lab #3 (bootstrapping, mostly okay)
#-	Interval Estimation Part III (Normal Approximations)
#	Need to make/update
#	1 prop -> 2 prop -> 1 mean -> 2 means, but quick
#-	Lab #4 (confidence intervals, need to make, include confounding in there and maybe intro to using intervals to do a test?)
#-	Hypothesis Testing Part I (Null Distributions and p-values)
#	Mostly good, might need to update

### Datasets

- [Happy Planet](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/HappyPlanet.csv)
    - This dataset was assembled by [The Happy Planet Index](http://happyplanetindex.org/) using data from a global survey that asks respondents questions about how they feel their lives are going. It documents the health and well-being of the inhabitants of various nations around the world. 
- [Mass Shootings](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/MassShootings.csv)
    - This dataset was originally assembled in response to the movie theater shooting in Aurora Colorado by [Mother Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)), a liberal news organization.  It documents shootings in the United States where a lone gunman (with a few exceptions involving two shooters) killed at least four individuals (not including themselves) at a single location (with a few exceptions involving multiple locations within a short period). Variables include: demographic characteristics of the shooter, information on when/where the shooting occurred, information on the number of victims, and information about the mental health status of the shooter.
- [Death Penalty Sentencing](https://remiller1450.github.io/data/DeathPenaltySentencing.csv)
    - This dataset comes from a [widely cited study](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12039&context=journal_articles) on racially biased sentencing in the Florida court system during the 1970s. Researchers collected data on all murders that took place during a felony commited in the state of Florida between 1972 and 1977.  They record the race of the victim and the offender, as well as whether the offered was sentenced to the death penalty.
