## Introduction

Data science is an already huge field that growing larger every day, it is unrealistic to expect to master it by taking a single course or reading a single book.  The goal of this course is to provide you with a solid foundation in the most important data science tools.  

On the surface the topics of this course might seem like mostly programming tasks, but if ask veteran data scientists, or read any of the dozens of "What makes a data scientist blogposts", you will continuously hear things like "thinking", "communication", and "problem solving skills", while hearing comparatively little about specific programming tools.  If you don't believe me, here are links to a few examples:

- [What Makes a Great Data Scientist?](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/03/what-makes-great-data-scientist.html)
- [The Top 3 Qualities of a Great Data Scientist](https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/20/the-top-3-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist/)
- [What Characteristics Make for a Good Data Scientist?](https://www.quora.com/What-characteristics-make-for-a-good-data-scientist)

## The Goals of this Activity

The focus of this activity will be thinking and communicating. We'll rely upon an interactive visualization app that has already been created; I will mention that, although we didn't make this one, we will learn how to develop these types of interactive visualizations later on in the course.

## Background

On August 12th, 2013, US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled in the course case [Floyd vs. City of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_v._City_of_New_York) that the [stop-and-frisk policy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/stop_and_frisk) used by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) was unconstitutional.  The decision was a culmination of years of public outcry against preceived racial profiling by the NYPD. 

Stop-and-frisk policies were first implented in New York as a means of reducing crime rates, with proponents arguing that preventing smaller crimes leads to less escalation and fewer violent crimes (see also [Broken Windows Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)).  Opponents accused the NYPD of racial discrimination in their stops.  The NYPD defended their practices, claiming that most crimes occur in predominately black neighborhoods, so it makes sense for a higher proportion of blacks to be stopped.

Prior to the 2013 District Court ruling, a record 685,724 stops were made in 2011, the majority which involved Black and Hispanic individuals  After the ruling, a mandate was passed which required officers to thoroughly justify their reasons for making a stop.  By 2013, the number of stops fell to 22,929.

In this lab we will use data to explore the controversy surrounding stop-and-frisk using an interactive visualization tool:

- [The NYPD Bar Charts App](http://shiny.grinnell.edu/NYPD_Bar_Charts/)

The was built using data provided by New York public records. Within this app there are several potential outcome variables, understanding these variables is essential to making sense of the data:

- Stopped: indicates an individual was stopped by the NYPD
- Frisked: individuals who are stopped may be frisked (patted down)
- Searched: individuals who are stopped may be searched, searches are more invasive than frisks and may occur if frisk provides suspicion of illicit activity
- Arrested: if evidence of illegal activity is found during a frisk or a search an arrest can be made
- Force: if force (see categories) is used by the officer during a stop

For more details on the data see: [NYPD App Variable Descriptions Link](http://web.grinnell.edu/individuals/kuipers/stat2labs/Handouts/NYPD/NYPDVariableDescriptions.pdf)

## Investigating Disparities using Bar Charts

Prior to starting questions 1-5, make certain the app is set to the following:

- Y-axis Variable:	Stopped
- X-axis Variable:	Race
- Y-axis Measurement:	Counts
- Choose the Years:	2006-2016	
- Facet By:	None
- Color By:	None

**Question #1**

According to a study using data from the late 1990s (Gelman, Fagan, Kiss, 2012), Blacks and Hispanics represented 51\% and 33\% of stops while only making up 26\% and 24\% of the New York City population.  Do Blacks and Hispanics appear to make up a similar proportion of stops in 2006-2014? Estimate the percentage of stops for Black and Hispanics individuals using the information in the bar chart.

**Question #2**

As of the 2010 Census, the population of New York City was 33.3% non-Hispanic white, 23% non-Hispanic black, 0.6% Native American, 12.7% Asian, 28.6% Hispanic (of any race), and 1.8% other races.  Briefly explain why this information is important to consider?

**Question #3**

Choose *year* in the Facet By menu. Is the racial breakdown of stops consistent from 2006-2014? Are Black and Hispanic individuals consistently stopped more often than individuals of other races?

**Question #4**

Change the Y-axis variable to *Frisked*. What do you see?  Now change the Y-axis variable to *Arrested*. What do you see?

## Counts versus Percentages

At this point we've confirmed that the NYPD police reports show more Black and Hispanic individuals are stopped, frisked, and arrested than people of other races.  We also saw that this patterns appears to be fairly consistent over time.  My these trends might be indicative of a problem, there are numerous other factors that need to be carefuly considered before concluding that there is evidence of discrimination.  The population, the location, the type of crime, and whether or not the person is guilty should all be taken into account.  Additionally, the patterns we see in the numbers of frisked or arrested suspects is directly impacted by the number of stops.  For example, if there are more stops of a particular race, it is reasonable to expect more frisks and arrests of that race assuming those stops were warranted.  To address this issue, we can consider looking at conditional percentages rather than counts

For questions 5 and 6, use the following settings:

- Y-axis Variable:	Frisked
- X-axis Variable:	Race
- Y-axis Measurement:	Percentage of stops
- Choose the Years:	2006-2016
- Facet By:	None
- Color By:	None

**Question #5**

In a 2007 study, Ridgeway concludes "Nonwhites generally experienced slightly more intrusive stops, in terms of having more frequent frisks and searchs than similarly situated white suspects".  Looking at both frisks and searches as a percentage of stops, is this claim verified? Why should have the Y-axis measurement be the percentage of stops, rather than just the raw numbers, when evaluating this claim?  

**Question #6**

Change Facet By to *Year*, have there been any changes in frisks and searches over time? What might be driving these changes?

## Using the Data to Tell a Story

We've now seen that after changing from counts to percentages the differences between Black, Hispanic, and White groups is much smaller.  In fact, there are several years where White individuals have a slightly higher percentage of searches during stops. 

**Question #7**

Putting yourself in the shoes of an opponent of the NYPD stop-and-frisk policy, choose 1-2 visuals that you feel make the strongest case against the legitimacy of the policy. Using your chosen visuals, write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) that uses the data to argue against the policy. Your answer should include and reference screenshots of the specific visuals you chose.

**Question #8**

Putting yourself in the shoes of a proponent of the NYPD stop-and-frisk policy, choose 1-2 visuals that you feel make the strongest case for the legitimacy of the policy. Using your chosen visuals, write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) that uses the data to argue against the policy. Your answer should include and reference screenshots of the specific visuals you chose.

## Drawing Conclusions 

While all of the graphs created in this activity come from the same dataset, each can be used to tell seemingly different stories. This highlights the importance of quantitative reasoning when viewing any numeric or graphical summary. In addition to the important details of how the data were collected, one should be cogniscent of both what is being shown, as well as what is not being shown.  Even when the data is accurate and the graphs are made correctly, data displays can be easily misunderstood.
