<div id="policies" class="section level3">
<h3>Policies</h3>
<p><strong>Class Sessions</strong></p>
<p>The core component of our class meetings will be working through
hands-on labs in a paired programming environment. These pairs will be
assigned during the first few weeks of the semester, then you will have
the freedom to choose your partner, or work independently near someone
that you can occasionally consult with. During labs it is essential that
you and your partner(s) work together, making certain that each of you
understand your work equally well.</p>
<p>Most labs will begin with a brief “preamble” section that we will go
through together as class. The purpose of this section is to introduce
the topic of the lab and ensure a smooth start to each class
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
<p>Because this course involves substantial group work absences impact
not only yourself, but also your classmates. That said, I understand
that missing class is sometimes necessary. If you will be absent for any
reason I ask to be notified as soon as possible. Showing up late or
missing class more than twice without prior notice will negatively
impact the participation component of your course grade.</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>Software is an essential component of data science and will play an
important role in this course. We will primarily use <code>R</code>, an
open-source statistical software program. You will also be expected to
write, document, and submit code used for projects and assignments
throughout the semester.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use your own personal laptop, or a Grinnell
College laptop, during the course. <code>R</code> is freely available
and you can download it and it’s UI companion, <code>R Studio</code>,
here (note: <code>R</code> must be downloaded and installed before
<code>R Studio</code>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download <code>R</code> from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"
class="uri">http://www.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>Download <code>R Studio</code> from <a
href="http://www.rstudio.com/"
class="uri">http://www.rstudio.com/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>You may also work on a classroom computer, all of which will have
<code>R</code> and <code>R Studio</code> pre-installed.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>
<p>At Grinnell College you are part of a conversation among scholars,
professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual
community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and
writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you
submit-all these are ways you participate in this conversation.</p>
<p>The College presumes that your work for any course is your own
contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to take
responsibility for that contribution. That is, you should strive to
present ideas and data fairly and accurately, indicate what is your own
work, and acknowledge what you have derived from others. This care
permits other members of the community to trace the evolution of ideas
and check claims for accuracy.</p>
<p>Failure to live up to this expectation constitutes academic
dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is misrepresenting someone else’s
intellectual effort as your own. Within the context of a course, it also
can include misrepresenting your own work as produced for that class
when in fact it was produced for some other purpose. A complete list of
dishonest behaviors, as defined by Grinnell College, <a
href="https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&amp;navoid=2537#alleged-violation">can
be found here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusive Classroom</strong></p>
<p>Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with
documented disabilities. To receive accommodations, students must
provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources,
information <a
href="http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services">can
be found here</a>. If you plan on using accommodations in this course,
you should speak with me as early as possible in the semester so that we
can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Holidays</strong></p>
<p>Grinnell College encourages students who plan to observe holy days
that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult
with your instructor in the first three weeks of classes so that you may
reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your
religious observance, and the requirements of the course.</p>

</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p><strong>Engagement and Participation</strong> - 5%</p>
<p>Participation in a lab-heavy course is absolutely critical. During
labs you are expected to help your partner(s) learn the material (which
goes beyond simply answering the lab questions), and they are expected
to help you. Everyone will begin the semester with a baseline
participation score of 80%, which will then move up or down depending on
my subjective assessment of your behavior during class. You can very
quickly raise this score to 100% by doing a superb job helping your lab
partner(s), and working diligently to understand course material during
class. Alternatively, you can lower this score by skipping class,
letting your lab partner(s) do most of the work, using your phone or
surfing the web during class, etc. If you are ever unsure of your
participation standing, you can email me and I am happy to provide you
an interim assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>All labs contain embedded questions that you and your lab partner
will answer together. Each group member should submit their own copy of
the group’s answers via P-web prior to the assignment’s due-date.
Oftentimes multiple labs will be due at the same time, and you are
welcome to upload your answers as a single file. Some lab questions will
be scored for accuracy with feedback given, while others will be scored
for effort/completion. If it becomes clear that you are your partner are
using a “divide and conquer” approach to answering lab questions your
score on that assignment will be penalized. Sketch solutions will
typically be posted 3-5 days after lab write-ups are due. Any lab that
is turned in after sketch solutions are posted will receive no more than
50% credit.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Homework</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>There will be 5-7 individual homework assignments throughout the
semester. These assignments are naturally cumulative, and intended to
force you to combine concepts and methods from multiple labs. You are
welcome to get help from DASIL mentors, or Professor Miller, on these
assignments, but your submissions should be your own work, and you
should add the name(s) of anyone you received help from as a footnote on
the question that they helped you with. Most homework assignments will
also include a short reading and a reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Midterm Project #1</strong> - 5%</p>
<p>For this project, you will create 2-3 professional visualizations and
post your visualizations with a 100–200-word caption/description for
each. You will work on this project in a <em>group of two or three</em>.
If you combine two or more data sources with merging and joining, only
two visualizations are required. If you use a single data source, you
are expected to create three visualizations. You will be required to
peer review three other groups, and you can receive a small amount of
extra credit for peer reviewing every group.</p>
<p>You can find details on Midterm #1 <a href="s230f22/project1.html">at
this link</a></p>
<p><strong>Midterm Project #2</strong> - 20%</p>
<p>For this project, you will develop an <code>R Shiny</code> app that
visually explores a data set of your choosing. You may work on this
project <em>individually</em>, or in a group of <em>two</em>. You will
publish your app online and give a 5-minute in-class presentation
demonstrating the capabilities of your app and discussing some of the
trends in your data that your app displays. You will be evaluated on
both the features of your app and how well you communicate what you see
in the data.</p>
<p>You can find details on Midterm #2 <a href="s230f22/midterm2.html">at
this link</a></p>
<p><strong>Final Project</strong> - 30%</p>
<p>This project is a start-to-finish data science application on a
non-trivial data set. The final product is a three-page written report
accompanied by R code and documentation. You may work on this project
<em>individually</em>, or in a <em>group of two or three</em>. Please
note that you may only work with the same classmate(s) on a maximum of
two of the three projects.</p>
<p>You can find details on the final project <a

<h3>Misc</h3>
<p><strong>Why use R for Data Science?</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve spent time reading about data science online you’ll
undoubtedly have noticed the emphasis placed on the Python programming
language. Indeed, research from Cal State University found Python was
the most popular data science language in private industry, being
mentioned in 42% of data scientist job postings. However,
<code>R</code>, which was mentioned in 20% of job postings, is not far
behind and offers a few advantages when approaching data science from a
statistical perspective (hence this course having the STA prefix).</p>
<p>Both <code>R</code> and Python provide plenty of functions for data
manipulation. However, because R was created by academic statisticians,
it offers very strong data visualization and statistical modeling
packages. On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming
language that excels in production, deployment, and machine learning.
Regardless of each language’s strengths and weaknesses, as an
introductory course our focus is on the fundamental skills and thought
processes used in data science – which is something that can be
accomplished regardless of the tools used (which will change over time
anyways).</p>
<p><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to visiting office hours and completing the recommended
readings, there are many other ways in which you can find help on
assignments and projects.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/resources/data-inquiry-lab">Data
Science and Social Inquiry Lab (DASIL)</a> is staffed by mentors who are
experienced in <code>R</code> programming and may be able to
troubleshoot coding problems you are having. Many students who’ve
successfully completed this course have made extensive use of the DASIL
work space and its computing resources.</p>
<p>The online platform <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">Stack Overflow</a>
is a useful resource to find user-generated coding solutions to common
<code>R</code> problems. Nearly all professional data scientists have
needed to “look up” a coding strategy on a site like Stack Overflow at
some point in their career, and I have no problem with you doing the
same on assignments or projects. However, if you make substantial use of
a Stack Overflow answer (ie: actually integrating lines of code written
by someone else into your work, not just getting help identifying the
right functions/arguments) the expectation is that you cite or
acknowledge doing so.</p>
